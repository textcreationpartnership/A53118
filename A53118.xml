            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Parliaments care for the King and Country, and for removall of grievances.</head>
            <p>THE Parliament having with carefull ſedulity and indifatigable diligence wraſtled with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſtempers of the times and perills of this Kingdome, and finding a malignant and impetuous enemy daily oppoſe them, who are the ſole and only obſtacles and hindrance of their beneficiall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinds (I need not involve my ſelfe in a too myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcription) I meane the Papiſts who like foggy clouds ſtrive to obſcure the glorious Sunſhine of the Church of England, as alſo to derogate from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Parliaments: And although they have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſpired to ſubvert and diſſolve, not only that illuſtrious Aſſembly, but conſequently the whole Kingdome, and not onely this Kingdome but that of Ireland likewiſe as is aforeſaid; yet thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos Pillars of this Realm now aſſembled have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their pernicious counſells, and diſſipated their deſignes; and as their inveterate malice hath beene moſt againſt this City of London being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſtrength of this Kingdome, ſo the Parliaments vigilancy hath beene moſt for the ſecurity of the ſame: They have oftimes intruded themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Kings favourites promiſing his Majeſty all fidelity and faithfull loyalty to his Imperiall Crown and roy all Dignity, though indeed they did but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him in calumnious outſhewes, for they are the ſole enemies that quotidianly ſtrive rather to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

            <p>The Parliament therefore taking theſe with many other like matters of high conſequence into their conſideration as chiefly concerning the welfare of the ſtate, provided for the diſarming of recuſants, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuch as were of power and of moſt ability to make reſiſtance, as alſo for ſetling ſuch offices as were to bee imployed in matters of truſt, chuſing thoſe whoſe former demerits and vertues might challenge to them acceptation of ſuch honours whoſe endeavours have beene peaceable, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the propagation of Proteſtant Religion, and the depreſſing of Papiſticall ſuperſtitions, for the which they have removed Officers as were formerly Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of his Majeſties Forts and Caſtles towards the ſea, putting in ſuch as were well affected by the Counties whereas the Caſtles are, who beſt knowe their deſerts, the putting their ſouldery in a poſture of warlike defence to the intent to avoid the danger of innovations by a forraine enemy, leſt they be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed unawares, all which are tokens of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments care towards this Kingdome, to the exceeding joy of the Commons, and perpetuall renowne of both the honorable Houſes, for whoſe labours and
